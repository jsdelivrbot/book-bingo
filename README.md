Every year, the [Reddit Fantasy community](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy) runs a reading challenge called Fantasy Bingo. It works exactly as you'd expect: the people in charge create 25 reading challenges, and place them in a 5x5 grid. Participants read books which fit these challenges, with the goal of marking off a full row (or, in a lot of cases, the entire grid).

This app is going to make the whole process simpler and more enjoyable!

## Project Status

Currently on hold. Likely to be no progress until late August, since we'll be moving to Edinburgh around then!
